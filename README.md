## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Clipboard Monitoring**: The assistant constantly watches for text changes in your clipboard. It activates whenever new content is copied or selected.
   
2. **Processing**: Once the content is detected, Sparkle AI uses either **Gemini** or **Ollama** to process the text:
   - **Gemini**: A cutting-edge Google model designed for precise analysis of both casual and technical texts.
   - **Ollama**: An AI model that streams content progressively, providing insights as it processes.
   
3. **AI Responses**: After processing, the assistant responds directly on your screen with clear, relevant explanations.

4. **Interaction**: You can interact with Sparkle AI through an interactive overlay, where you can send additional messages or request further information.

## üîß Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Sparkle AI is built with Python 3, leveraging libraries like PyQt6 for the UI, Ollama for AI, and Gemini for enhanced text processing.
- **Dependencies**:
    - `pyperclip`: For clipboard interaction.
    - `win32gui`, `win32con`: For system tray and window manipulation on Windows.
    - `ollama`: To interact with the Ollama AI model.
    - `requests`: For internet connectivity checks.
    - `keyboard`: For capturing hotkeys.
    - `langchain_google_genai`: To interface with the Gemini API.

### Running in Debug Mode

You can track the application‚Äôs inner workings by enabling the debug mode. This will give you timestamps for every key action, ensuring you know exactly what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes.

```python
def debug_print(message):
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S.%f")[:-3]
    print(f"[DEBUG {timestamp}] {message}")
    sys.stdout.flush()  # Force immediate output
```

### Architecture Overview

Sparkle AI uses a **multi-threaded design**:
- **TextProcessor Thread**: Handles text processing asynchronously, ensuring the UI remains responsive while the AI processes your input.
- **OverlayWidget**: Manages the UI for displaying responses, errors, and processing status.
- **System Tray Icon**: Acts as a control center, where users can toggle the assistant‚Äôs active status.

### Handling AI Responses

When text is processed, **Gemini** or **Ollama** are used depending on the settings. These models return either a structured or stream-based response, which Sparkle displays to the user.

```python
response = self._process_with_gemini()
```

### Error Handling

Errors encountered during processing or internet issues are gracefully caught and displayed on the overlay with clear error messages, ensuring a smooth user experience.
